# Twitter Clone : Social platform
Developed a social platform where everyone can post their tweet which can be shown to followed users. Worked on implementing features like Login, Signup, Create Tweet, Follow User, Unfollow user and UI screens. Used Postgres as database, Spring MVC framework for back-end, jQuery, HTML and JavaScript. REST APIs were tested to take average serving speed below 50 ms on localhost.
